Radical rule changes shake up the order and Mercedes’ W13 lands wide of the mark, leaving them ‘best of the rest’ behind Red Bull and Ferrari. Newcomer George Russell takes their sole victory – and outscores Lewis Hamilton, who goes winless for the first time in his F1 career.

<strong class=""text-2xl font-audiowide font-light"">2021</strong>
Face the biggest challenge yet to their dominance of the turbo-hybrid. Lewis Hamilton loses his drivers’ crown to Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, despite winning eight races, as the team just about hang on to the constructors’ title, which they retain for an eighth successive season.

<strong class=""text-2xl font-audiowide font-light"">2020</strong>
Just when you think they can’t get any better, Mercedes – and in particular Lewis Hamilton – step it up another gear. The reigning champion wins 11 races and smashes records galore en route to a Schumacher-equalling seventh drivers' title, despite missing a round with Covid-19. Add two wins for Valtteri Bottas and it’s another dominant double crown for the Silver Arrows.

<strong class=""text-2xl font-audiowide font-light"">2019</strong>
Start the season with an unprecedented five one-two victories, and follow it up with a further 10 wins, thus securing their sixth title double on the bounce. All-round teamwork, rather than outright pace, is often the key to success. Valtteri Bottas ups his game, meaning Lewis Hamilton has to work hard to secure his sixth drivers’ crown, bringing the Brit tantalising close to matching Michael Schumacher’s all-time record.",Lewis Hamilton,George Russel,https://media.formula1.com/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1677244973/content/dam/fom-website/2018-redesign-assets/Flags%2016x9/germany-flag.png

Sebastian Vettel gave validity to the approach almost immediately, delivering a fairy-tale win in 2008, before going on to enjoy world championship success with parent team Red Bull Racing. Today the ethos of nurturing talent still holds true, though the Italian squad are no longer simply a ‘B team’ but a constructor in their own right...

Eventful final campaign under AlphaTauri moniker culminates with P8 in the standings. Newcomer Nyck de Vries dropped mid-season in favour of the experienced Daniel Ricciardo – who then misses five Grands Prix with a broken hand following a practice crash.

Momentum stalls and lose ground to the likes of Alfa Romeo and Haas, dropping to P9 in the final standings, with just 35 points to 2021’s tally of 142. Pierre Gasly takes season’s best result with a fifth place in Baku, but departs the squad at the end of the year.

Move up another place to sixth in the standings, as the ever-improving Pierre Gasly scores a podium in Azerbaijan and points in almost every race he finishes. Rookie team mate Yuki Tsunoda takes time to find his feet, but secures an excellent fourth in season finale.

A new name brings new impetus and AlphaTauri emerge as a true midfield force, scoring more than a century of points, 27 of them on home soil at Monza, where Pierre Gasly secures his and the team’s maiden win.

Nonetheless, the scale of their success over the following decade was staggering. After a first podium in 2006, the team hit their stride in 2009, claiming six victories and second in the constructors' standings. Over the next four seasons they were a tour de force, claiming consecutive title doubles between 2010 and 2013, with Sebastian Vettel emerging as the sport's youngest quadruple champion. Now they are recapturing that glory with an equally exciting talent – one named Max Verstappen…

<strong class=""text-2xl font-audiowide font-light"">2023</strong>
In the hands of Max Verstappen, the RB19 proves all but invincible, the team winning all but one race en route to a second consecutive championship double. Record-breaking campaign also results in their first-ever one-two finish in driver standings.

After seeing off early Ferrari challenge, dominate to take first title double since 2013, with Max Verstappen securing a record 15 wins to retain drivers’ crown. Only cloud is a $7 million fine and a reduction in future wind-tunnel testing for exceeding the 2021 budget cap.

Secure their first drivers’ championship since 2013, winning 11 of 22 races, and push Mercedes all the way in an intense – and, at times, bitter – constructors’ fight. New team mate Sergio Perez provides invaluable support to Max Verstappen’s successful title bid.

<strong class=""text-2xl font-audiowide font-light"">2020</strong>
A lonely second in the standings, consistently clear of the midfield but rarely able to match the pace of champions Mercedes. Max Verstappen stars – with two wins and another nine podiums – but Alex Albon is dropped for 2021 after just two top-three appearances.

Transition from Renault to Honda power is remarkably smooth, and Max Verstappen’s four wins ensure an almost identical points tally to 2018.
